            helpful for specific things, and most fall into one or more of these

              Choosing a language that helps you build a project you enjoy makes
              the experience of learning to code so much better. You‚Äôll also
              find it easier to push through when you‚Äôre frustrated.

              If your goal is a career change, I highly recommend searching for
              jobs you would enjoy at companies you‚Äôre interested in and see
              what qualifications are listed. Finding the commonalities among a
              few positions and starting there will save you a lot of
              guess-work.

              Most people tend to find front-end development more intuitive and
              approachable when getting started. I would recommend starting with
              HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. Once you have learned the basics
              of those, I would add in Express and any of SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL.
              This group of languages, or ‚Äòtech-stack‚Äô is fully accessible on
              any operating system and should be good enough to learn any skills

            I would encourage you to find a rhythm that works for you and stick
            with it, taking blocks of time at least three days a week. I used to
            think that these needed to be huge blocks of time, but just an hour

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Tutorials can be valuable, but they have limits as well. For
            example, when I was learning Python, I followed a tutorial to build
            a basic blog on Youtube. After about 10 hours, I finished the
            tutorial and realized that I had a blog, but I did not know Python
            any better than I did when I started.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Exploration, on the other hand, forces you to learn the language and
            apply the fundamental concepts of the language in new situations.
            Through exploration, you learn when to use what you‚Äôve learned,
            which is much more helpful.

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            It may be slower, but I would encourage as much exploration as
            possible when learning. There are plenty of resources for project
            ideas below, but try to build the projects with as little
            instruction as possible. You will find that the concepts stick much

            In my experience, using metaphors in the learning process speeds up

            works even better if the metaphor is a bad one. Some metaphors that
            I have used in the past include: language (grammar/syntax), lego

            to Lego bricks. Within the paradigm of Lego bricks, these
            ‚Äòcomponents‚Äô are stacked together to form more complex ‚Äòcomponents‚Äô,

              - Skill-based paths are less structured than FreeCodeCamp. They
              point to the resources necessary for completing the projects
              rather than guiding you directly. They often offer a reading list
              and guidelines, then leave it to you to figure out the rest. The
              Odin Project has excellent soft-skills lessons and a ton of
              additional resources. That said, the Odin Project is not a
              traditional tutorial site in the sense that all learning is
              largely self-guided. As such, it may be less approachable for some
              people.

              - These sites offer practice word problems sorted by language,
              difficulty, and data structures. While they don‚Äôt offer projects
              to build, I do find them useful for practicing things that you‚Äôre
              finding difficult. For instance, I struggled with learning lists
              in Python, so I practiced here until I was more comfortable with
              that skill. I would advise you to pick whichever you prefer and
              use it sparingly when you find you‚Äôre struggling with particular
              concepts.

            that documentation is the worst way to learn a language, especially
            for beginners. In most cases, it‚Äôs like trying to learn a human
            language by reading a dictionary. That said, dictionaries are
            essential as a reference for learning a language. In the same way,

            useful when you approach it with a specific question in mind. Just
            be sure that the documentation you‚Äôre reading matches the version of

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Most programming languages offer some form of printing, or logging
            information to the console. For instance, if you have a Javascript
            variable called exampleData, you can log/print that variable to the
            console to understand the data it contains. This can be helpful for
            troubleshooting because you can see what data is being passed, how
            that data is being transformed, or which code is being run.

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            That said, printing is not interactive in the sense that it either
            runs or it doesn‚Äôt. There is not much information about why it was
            executed or not, nor can you access any information around your
            print command. Printing can be extremely useful, but it takes a
            while to learn what to print in order to get the information you
            need.

            Debugging refers to the process of interrupting your code at
            specific points to learn more about the way it is functioning. It is
            one of the most helpful skills you can learn, especially early on,
            in the sense that it is more interactive than printing. When
            debugging, the code is stopped in the middle of its execution and
            you can walk through line by line to make sure you understand what‚Äôs
            happening. For this reason, it saves a tremendous amount of time. I
            don‚Äôt like to think about the amount of time I could have saved

            Google Chrome has excellent debugging tools built into the browser.

            using Chrome developer tools. A 30-50 minute video could help save
            endless hours of trying to figure out what‚Äôs going wrong.

            If your code is not running in a web browser like Chrome, most code
