                      <b>Clear explanation of your actions:</b> It should be very clear from this document exactly what *you* did and how that action led to the outcome. ‚ÄúLed the project‚Äù is probably too vague.

                  Brag documents are very flexible. Assuming you have the relevant information in each entry, you have a lot of creative freedom to structure entries in a way that makes sense to you. However, It‚Äôs important to keep it simple so that you‚Äôre more likely to keep it updated. My rule of thumb for brag documents is to keep it simple enough that you can make a new entry in less than one minute.

This also has the advantage of giving you a head-start when preparing for interviews, since the STAR Method is now the industry standard for behavioral interviews.

                  1. Share it with your manager.
              </Typography>

              <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                  Sharing examples from your brag document with your manager has two key advantages:
              </Typography>

              <ol>
                  <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'li'}>
                      You increase the visibility into your work. Your manager is likely pretty busy and it‚Äôs impossible to expect them to remember (or even hear about) all of your accomplishments. The more context they get from you, the more likely it is that they can be a good advocate for you.
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'li'}>
                      You increase the amount of time your manager can spend crafting focused feedback. Since your manager isn‚Äôt starting from a blank page, they can spend more time reflecting on your work than on remembering it.
                  </Typography>
              </ol>

              <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                  This may be a bit controversial but, if you‚Äôre comfortable with it, I highly recommend creating a role-specific copy of your brag document and sharing the entire document with your manager directly. This makes the process of sharing your accomplishments a <i>collaborative</i> effort and ensures that they have the context they need <i>when they need it</i> Conversations about promotions and compensation adjustments will likely happen when you‚Äôre not in the room, and equipping your manager with the context they need will help them be a good advocate for you.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                  That said, not everyone will want to share their brag document directly. If you‚Äôre uncomfortable with that level of visibility (or if your manager has lost your trust), that‚Äôs completely understandable. In that case, try sharing your brag document <i>indirectly</i> by occasionally sharing key updates from your brag document in a 1:1 or through direct messages. That way, you can still ensure that your manager knows about your accomplishments.
              </Typography>

              <Typography variant={'h3'} component={'h3'}>
                  2. Don‚Äôt forget the little things.
              </Typography>

              <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                  Not every accomplishment involves launching a new product. Many important skills for senior-level roles (such as influencing others, removing roadblocks, or mentoring teammates) happen behind-the-scenes and are therefore more difficult to quantify during a performance review. Including specific, high-impact examples of your soft-skills in your brag document will make it much easier to illustrate these skills later.
              </Typography>

              <Typography variant={'h3'} component={'h3'}>
                  3. Connect it to your career ladder.
              </Typography>

              <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                  Your career ladder is your company‚Äôs wishlist of employee traits. By linking your accomplishments to specific areas of your career ladder, you are effectively saying ‚ÄúYou told me you want X. I gave you X this quarter, and here‚Äôs when/how I did it.‚Äù
              </Typography>

              <Callout>
                  <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                      üìà Looking for a promotion? Try linking your accomplishments to the career ladder <i>one level above your current role</i>. If you can prove that you‚Äôve been performing at the next level for past 3-6 months, you will make the case for your promotion even stronger.
                  </Typography>
              </Callout>

              <Typography variant={'body1'} component={'p'}>
                  If your company doesn&apos;t have a career ladder that‚Äôs visible to employees, try connecting your accomplishments to their <i>core values</i> instead. While core values aren‚Äôt as role-specific, they do reflect your company‚Äôs ideal employee. They provide a way to link your accomplishment to something the company values.
